          Doctor Who recently released the trailer for Jodie Whittaker’s final
          adventure as The Doctor, and with its arrival came even more questions
          about her replacement. Rumors abound regarding which actor(s) could
          step into the role, with Whittaker and Chris Chibnall's exit paving
          the way for Russell T. Davies’ return, though few avenues of
          speculation could possible excite viewers more than the evergreen
          potential for David Tennant to return. When the always busy and always
          excellent actor directly and indirectly addressed the rumors of his
          possible franchise return, he gave fans something to think about.
          David Tennant took part in a Q&A panel at the Spring Edition of German
          Comic Con, and was obviously asked about the rumors saying he’ll
          reprise his role as The Doctor when Russell T. Davies returns. Tennant
          acknowledged he’s aware of such talk, and responded to it by saying
          that it's something he's been dealing with ever since he exited the
          role in the first place. In his words:
